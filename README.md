# Compendium Editor

The Compendium Editor is a helpful tool for anyone using **Fight Club 5e** or **Game Master 5th Edition**, making it easy to add and edit content without having to learn how to use XML.

Instead of dealing with tags or code, you can type, choose from templates, or import your content from the clipboard into a **simple editor** that does most of the hard work for you. The app comes with several handy tools to automatize and clean up copied text from PDFs, saving you time and effort.

- **Automatic Paragraph Formatting** – Converts large blocks of copied text into properly formatted paragraphs.
- **Title and Description Recognition** – Detects headings, descriptions, and other key sections to organize content clearly.
- **Dice Roll Formatting** – Identifies dice notations (e.g., "1d20 + 5") and can automatically add them to the feature.
- **Whitespace and Line Break Cleanup** – Removes extra spaces and unnecessary line breaks.
- **Neat and Organized Lists** – Tidies up lists and structures them properly.
- **Compile your own compendium** – Select the sources you want to add and compile them into a complete compendium, ready to be imported into **Fight Club 5e** or **Game Master 5th Edition**.
